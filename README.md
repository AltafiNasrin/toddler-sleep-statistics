# Statistical Analysis of Toddler Sleep Patterns

This project analyzes behavioral sleep data from toddlers using classical statistical methods to explore differences between napping and non-napping groups.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Evaluate sleep behavior differences in toddlers using statistical inference.
- **Dataset**: Sleep study data including bedtime, night sleep duration, and 24-hour total sleep.
- **Techniques**: Confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, linear regression.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, matplotlib
- scipy, statsmodels

## 🧪 Key Steps
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Estimation of confidence intervals for sleep metrics
- Two-sample t-tests and effect size analysis
- OLS regression modeling and diagnostics

## 📁 Files
- `Confidence interval-toddler sleep habits.ipynb`
- `Hypothesis testing-toddler sleep habits.ipynb`

## 📈 Results
- Statistically significant differences were found in bedtime and total sleep duration between napping and non-napping toddlers.
- Linear regression models helped interpret the influence of sleep variables and demographics.

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
Demonstrates practical use of statistical inference tools for real-world behavioral data analysis.
